Below is an interactive, hierarchical graph of the structure of one play: __[Oshun and Dembei (Chikagoro kawara no tatehiki / 近頃河原の達引)]({{ "plays/6" | relative_url }})__, including links to its authors and productions in which it was performed, which in turn link to scenes which link to performer information.

You can __click on the circles__ to open or collapse nodes or __double-click on one with a bolded name__ to learn more about its corresponding author, performance, scene, performer, character, or kashira (puppet).
