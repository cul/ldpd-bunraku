### The Music of Bunraku

Bunraku is a truly collaborative effort between puppeteers, chanters, and musicians. The puppeteers do not speak; it is the chanters who recite all the spoken parts and the narratives, altering their voices to represent each of the characters as well as to provide the narration. The musicians accompany them on the three-stringed _shamisen_.

The following selected audio files illustrate the complexity and variety of narration and music in Bunraku.
